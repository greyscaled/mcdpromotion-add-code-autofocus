# mcdpromotion-add-code-autofocus

This is a web extension to autofocus the `<input>` for adding Monopoly codes
on <https://mcdpromotion.ca>. I'm not affiliated with McDonalds or that website
in any way, shape or form. I just happen to have a few stickers (plus the ones
my family gathers), and I got tired of clicking "Add Code" then having to click
on the input.

I realize this is probably one of the weirdest extensions to make. It was
mostly an excuse just to make one (and work with `MutationObserver`).

Because it's not overly useful, I am not going to publish or distribute it.
I'm also not going to provide development details or actively maintain this
extension.

If you'd like to use it, follow these steps:

-   obtain the source (ie: `git clone`)
-   run `make build`
-   unpack the `build` directory as a web extension
